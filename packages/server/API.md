# Lookout Server API Documentation

**Framework:** Fastify v5
**Base URL:** `http://localhost:3000` (configurable via `PORT` and `BASE_URL` env vars)

---

## Authentication

### Public Routes (Session Token)
Public endpoints use a 64-character hex **session token** as a path parameter. No header-based auth required.

### Internal Routes (API Key)
Internal endpoints require the `X-API-Key` header matching the `INTERNAL_API_KEY` environment variable. Uses constant-time comparison.

---

## Rate Limiting

In-memory sliding window (60-second windows). Rate-limited responses return:

- **Status:** `429 Too Many Requests`
- **Header:** `Retry-After: <seconds>`
- **Body:** `{ "error": "Rate limit exceeded" }`

| Endpoint | Limit | Key |
|----------|-------|-----|
| `GET /api/sessions/:token` | 60 req/min | per token |
| `PATCH /api/sessions/:token/name` | 20 req/min | per token |
| `GET /api/sessions/:token/upload-url` | 10 req/min | per session ID |
| `POST /api/sessions/:token/screenshots` | 20 req/min | per token |
| `POST /api/sessions/:token/pause` | 10 req/min | per token |
| `POST /api/sessions/:token/resume` | 10 req/min | per token |
| `POST /api/sessions/:token/stop` | 10 req/min | per token |
| `GET /api/sessions/:token/status` | 60 req/min | per token |
| `GET /api/sessions/:token/timings` | 30 req/min | per token |
| `GET /api/sessions/:token/video` | 30 req/min | per token |
| `GET /api/sessions/:token/thumbnail` | 30 req/min | per token |
| `POST /api/sessions/batch` | 30 req/min | per IP |
| `GET /api/media/:sessionId/thumbnail.jpg` | 60 req/min | per session ID |
| `GET /api/media/:sessionId/video.mp4` | 30 req/min | per session ID |
| `GET /api/media/:sessionId/video.webm` | 30 req/min | per session ID |

---

## Error Format

All errors follow this shape:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 400 | Bad request / validation error |
| 401 | Unauthorized (invalid API key) |
| 404 | Resource not found |
| 409 | Conflict (invalid state transition) |
| 429 | Rate limited |
| 500 | Server error |

## Session States

```
pending → active → paused → active → stopped → compiling → complete
                                   ↘              ↗
                                    stopped ──────
                                                  ↘ failed
```

Valid states: `pending`, `active`, `paused`, `stopped`, `compiling`, `complete`, `failed`

State transitions use optimistic locking — if a concurrent request changes the session state between read and update, the server returns `409 Conflict` with the message `"Session state changed concurrently, please retry"`.

---

## Tracking Modes

`trackedSeconds` is computed by one of two server-side algorithms. Mode is decided by the **first** upload of a session and stays sticky for the session's lifetime.

### Bucket mode (legacy, pre-0.2.1 clients)

- Activated when the first `GET /upload-url` request omits `capturedAt`.
- `trackedSeconds = (distinct confirmed minute buckets − 1) × 60`, where `minuteBucket = floor((serverNow − startedAt) / 60_000)`.
- Two captures landing in the same server-receive minute count as one bucket.
- Subsequent uploads can send `capturedAt` — the server stores it for debugging but won't flip the mode.

### Credit mode (0.2.1+ clients)

- Activated when the first `GET /upload-url` request includes `capturedAt`.
- A **streak anchor** is set to the seed capture's `capturedAt`; the server then expects each subsequent capture at `anchor + (creditedCount + 1) × 60s`.
- If `|capturedAt − expectedAt| ≤ 30s`: credit 60s, increment `creditedCount`, anchor unchanged.
- Else: credit 0s, reset anchor to this `capturedAt`, `creditedCount = 0`. Subsequent captures rebuild a streak from there.
- `trackedSeconds` is maintained incrementally on `sessions.tracked_seconds` — not recomputed from screenshots.
- Pause + resume clears the streak so the post-resume seed capture doesn't burn a 60s credit.
- Trust envelope: `capturedAt` must fall within `serverNow ± 5min` and be strictly monotonic.

### Why two modes exist

Pre-0.2.1 the bucket count caused timer jump-back when two captures arrived in the same minute (network jitter, late uploads). Credit mode anchors the math to the client's capture time so jitter that stays inside the ±30s window credits cleanly. Bucket mode is retained for compat with currently-shipped binaries — both run side by side on the same database.

### Client display guidance

- Trust `trackedSeconds` from the confirm response as ground truth. Do not derive a display value from `uploads.completed * intervalSeconds` — in credit mode, not every successful upload credits, and the derivation over-counts.
- Cap any client-side interpolation at one capture interval (60s) ahead of the last server credit. This bounds the worst-case drop at stop/compile to 60s, never the full session length.
- Schedule the next capture from each confirm's `nextExpectedAt`; the math behind it stays anchored to the original streak so individual upload jitter doesn't accumulate drift.

---

## Client Info

Recording clients report a free-form **client telemetry string** on every `upload-url` request (query param `clientInfo`). It is **not** the HTTP `User-Agent` — it's explicit info the Lookout client builds for telemetry/debugging. The server stores it opaquely per screenshot (**never parses it**) and surfaces the session's first recorded value on session-info endpoints (`GET /api/sessions/:token`, `GET /api/sessions/:token/timings`, internal admin).

Recommended (not enforced) format — User-Agent–like, encoding Lookout type, version, embedded host app (web/SDK), OS, and browser (web/SDK):

```
Lookout Desktop/0.2.6 (macOS 14.3)
Lookout Web (Fallout)/0.2.6 (macOS 14.3; Chrome 120.0)
Lookout Sdk (Stardance)/0.2.6 (Windows 10; Firefox 121.0)
```

- **Type** — `Desktop`, `Web`, `Sdk`, … (which Lookout client).
- **Embedded app** — for web/SDK, the host program Lookout runs inside (e.g. `Fallout`), in parentheses after the type.
- **Version** — the Lookout client version.
- **Environment** — OS type+version, and for web/SDK the browser type+version.

The value is best-effort: a client that can't detect part of this omits it; the server truncates anything over 1024 chars and never rejects an upload over a malformed `clientInfo`. It is `null` on responses for sessions recorded before this existed or where no client sent one.

---

## Public Endpoints

### Get Session Status

```
GET /api/sessions/:token
```

Returns the current state of a session.

**Path Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `token` | string | 64-char hex session token |

**Response `200 OK`:**
```json
{
  "status": "active",
  "trackedSeconds": 123,
  "screenshotCount": 45,
  "clientInfo": "Lookout Web (Fallout)/0.2.6 (macOS 14.3; Chrome 120.0)",
  "startedAt": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "totalActiveSeconds": 300,
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T11:50:00.000Z",
  "thumbnailUrl": "https://...",
  "videoUrl": "https://...",
  "metadata": {}
}
```

`clientInfo` is the [client telemetry string](#client-info) recorded on the session's **first** screenshot upload. It is `null` for sessions recorded before this was added, or where the client sent none.

---

### Rename Session

```
PATCH /api/sessions/:token/name
```

Updates the session's display name. Allowed at any session status.

**Path Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `token` | string | 64-char hex session token |

**Request Body:**
```json
{ "name": "My new name" }
```

| Field | Type | Required | Validation |
|-------|------|----------|------------|
| `name` | string | yes | 1–255 chars |

**Response `200 OK`:**
```json
{ "name": "My new name" }
```

**Errors:**
- `400` — Body missing `name` or out of length range
- `404` — Session not found
- `429` — Rate limit exceeded

---

### Get Presigned Upload URL

```
GET /api/sessions/:token/upload-url?capturedAt=<iso8601>
```

Generates a presigned PUT URL for uploading a screenshot to R2. Activates pending sessions on first call.

**Path Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `token` | string | 64-char hex session token |

**Query Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `capturedAt` | ISO-8601 (optional) | Client-attested moment the frame was grabbed. Presence on the **first** upload of a session sticks it to **credit mode** for life; absence sticks it to **bucket mode**. Subsequent uploads on a credit-mode session **must** include it. Must fall within ±5 min of server time and must be strictly monotonic across uploads. |
| `clientInfo` | string (optional) | [Client telemetry string](#client-info) (User-Agent-like). Stored opaquely per screenshot; the session's first non-empty value is surfaced on session-info endpoints. Best-effort — never parsed or validated, silently truncated to 1024 chars; an invalid/oversized value never fails the upload. |

**Response `200 OK`:**
```json
{
  "uploadUrl": "https://r2.cloudflarestorage.com/...",
  "r2Key": "screenshots/{sessionId}/{screenshotId}.jpg",
  "screenshotId": "uuid",
  "minuteBucket": 1,
  "nextExpectedAt": "2024-01-01T12:01:00.000Z",
  "serverTime": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "trackingMode": "credit"
}
```

`nextExpectedAt` is the server's authoritative target for the **next** capture's `capturedAt` — clients should schedule from it (see Tracking Modes below).

**Errors:**
- `400` — `captured_at_future`, `captured_at_too_old`, `captured_at_before_session_start`, `captured_at_not_monotonic`, `captured_at_invalid`, or `credit_mode_requires_captured_at`
- `404` — Session not found
- `409` — Session not in `pending` or `active` state
- `429` — Rate limit exceeded, or max upload requests per session reached (4320)

**Notes:**
- Presigned URL expires after 2 minutes
- Client should PUT the JPEG image directly to `uploadUrl`
- Max 4320 upload requests per session
- Pre-0.2.1 binaries that don't send `capturedAt` continue to receive a usable response — additive fields (`serverTime`, `trackingMode`) are gracefully ignored

---

### Confirm Screenshot Upload

```
POST /api/sessions/:token/screenshots
```

Confirms that a screenshot was successfully uploaded to R2. The server verifies the object exists and validates its content type and size.

**Path Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `token` | string | 64-char hex session token |

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "screenshotId": "uuid",
  "width": 1920,
  "height": 1080,
  "fileSize": 125000
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Validation |
|-------|------|----------|------------|
| `screenshotId` | string (UUID) | yes | Must match a pending screenshot |
| `width` | integer | yes | ≥ 1 |
| `height` | integer | yes | ≥ 1 |
| `fileSize` | integer | yes | ≥ 1 |

**Response `200 OK`:**
```json
{
  "confirmed": true,
  "trackedSeconds": 123,
  "nextExpectedAt": "2024-01-01T12:01:00.000Z",
  "serverTime": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

`trackedSeconds` here is the **server's authoritative count after this capture has been credited (or not)**. Use this value to drive your timer display — see the [Tracking Modes](#tracking-modes) section for client display guidance. `nextExpectedAt` is the target for the next capture's `capturedAt`.

**Errors:**
- `400` — Invalid content type (must be `image/jpeg`), file too large (max 2 MB), or object not found in R2
- `404` — Session or screenshot not found
- `409` — Session not in `pending` or `active` state
- `429` — Rate limit exceeded, or max confirmed screenshots reached (720)

**Notes:**
- Idempotent — confirming an already-confirmed screenshot returns success with current `trackedSeconds` and a freshly computed `nextExpectedAt`
- In credit mode the credit decision (60 vs 0) is recorded on the row as `credited_seconds`; the response only exposes the cumulative `trackedSeconds`

---

### Pause Session

```
POST /api/sessions/:token/pause
```

Pauses an active session. Accumulates active time up to this point.

**Path Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `token` | string | 64-char hex session token |

**Response `200 OK`:**
```json
{
  "status": "paused",
  "totalActiveSeconds": 123
}
```

**Errors:**
- `404` — Session not found
- `409` — Session in terminal state (`stopped`, `compiling`, `complete`, `failed`)

**Notes:**
- Idempotent for already-paused sessions
- Pending sessions return a no-op (0 active seconds)

---

### Resume Session

```
POST /api/sessions/:token/resume
```

Resumes a paused session.

**Path Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `token` | string | 64-char hex session token |

**Response `200 OK`:**
```json
{
  "status": "active",
  "nextExpectedAt": "2024-01-01T12:01:00.000Z"
}
```

**Errors:**
- `404` — Session not found
- `409` — Session not in `paused` state

---

### Stop Session

```
POST /api/sessions/:token/stop
```

Stops a session and enqueues video compilation if screenshots exist.

**Path Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `token` | string | 64-char hex session token |

**Response `200 OK`:**
```json
{
  "status": "stopped",
  "trackedSeconds": 123,
  "totalActiveSeconds": 300
}
```

**Errors:**
- `404` — Session not found
- `409` — Session already in terminal state

**Notes:**
- Marks session `complete` immediately if no screenshots exist (skips compilation)
- Accumulates any remaining active time

---

### Poll Compilation Status

```
GET /api/sessions/:token/status
```

Lightweight endpoint for polling compilation progress.

**Path Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `token` | string | 64-char hex session token |

**Response `200 OK`:**
```json
{
  "status": "compiling",
  "videoUrl": null,
  "trackedSeconds": 123
}
```

When complete:
```json
{
  "status": "complete",
  "videoUrl": "https://...",
  "trackedSeconds": 123
}
```

---

### Get Capture Timings

```
GET /api/sessions/:token/timings
```

Returns the ISO-8601 capture timestamps of **every confirmed screenshot** in the session, oldest first. Token-gated public endpoint. Uses each screenshot's `capturedAt` (client-attested capture moment); rows predating the `captured_at` column fall back to `requestedAt` so the array is never sparse.

**Path Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `token` | string | 64-char hex session token |

**Response `200 OK`:**
```json
{
  "status": "active",
  "count": 3,
  "first": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "last": "2024-01-01T12:02:00.000Z",
  "clientInfo": "Lookout Web (Fallout)/0.2.6 (macOS 14.3; Chrome 120.0)",
  "timestamps": [
    "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
    "2024-01-01T12:01:00.000Z",
    "2024-01-01T12:02:00.000Z"
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `status` | string | Current session status |
| `count` | integer | Number of timestamps returned (= confirmed screenshot count) |
| `first` | string \| null | Earliest timestamp (= `timestamps[0]`); `null` if no screenshots |
| `last` | string \| null | Latest timestamp (= last element); `null` if no screenshots |
| `clientInfo` | string \| null | [Client telemetry string](#client-info) from the session's first screenshot upload; `null` if none recorded |
| `timestamps` | string[] | ISO-8601 timestamps, ascending |

> **ℹ️ `count` is the number of screenshots, not minutes.** More than one capture can fall within the same minute (retries, resume, clock jitter), so `count` can exceed the number of distinct minutes — it is **not** a count of tracked minutes. For tracked time use `trackedSeconds`.

> **⚠️ `last − first` is not the recorded duration.** A session can be paused and resumed, leaving gaps between consecutive timestamps. The span from `first` to `last` is wall-clock elapsed time, which **overstates** actual capture time whenever the session was paused. To measure recorded time, use `trackedSeconds` from the [status endpoint](#poll-compilation-status), or sum the gaps between consecutive timestamps while excluding any larger than the capture interval.

**Availability:** Capture timestamps are available for timelapses recorded from **~2026-05-26** onward. Timelapses recorded before then did not have timestamps collected — for those, the endpoint returns `200` with `count: 0` and an empty `timestamps` array, even though the session is `complete` and still has a playable video.

**Timestamp precision:** For current recordings these are true capture times — the moment each frame was grabbed. Recordings from older legacy clients report a server-side time instead (when the upload was received), which trails the true capture by upload latency.

**Errors:**
- `404` — Session not found
- `429` — Rate limit exceeded

> **Note:** The original screenshot images are only retained for 7 days after a session stops, after which the JPEGs are deleted from storage. The capture timestamps returned by this endpoint — along with the compiled video and thumbnail — are kept.

---

### Get Video URL

```
GET /api/sessions/:token/video?format=mp4
```

Returns a URL to the compiled timelapse video. MP4 / H.264 is the only encoded format. The `?format=webm` query parameter is retained for pre-0.2.0 binaries — it returns a URL to a static "please update your client" video instead of an error.

**Path Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `token` | string | 64-char hex session token |

**Response `200 OK`:**
```json
{
  "videoUrl": "https://r2.cloudflarestorage.com/..."
}
```

**Errors:**
- `404` — Session not found or video not yet available
- `429` — Rate limit exceeded

**Notes:**
- Only available when session status is `complete`
- Presigned URL expires after 1 hour
- Output is H.264 MP4. WebKitGTK-based Linux browsers may need `gst-plugins-bad`/OpenH264 installed for playback.

---

### Get Thumbnail URL

```
GET /api/sessions/:token/thumbnail
```

Returns a presigned URL for the session thumbnail.

**Path Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `token` | string | 64-char hex session token |

**Response `200 OK`:**
```json
{
  "thumbnailUrl": "https://r2.cloudflarestorage.com/..."
}
```

**Errors:**
- `404` — Session not found, or thumbnail not available
- `429` — Rate limit exceeded

**Notes:**
- Presigned URL expires after 1 hour

---

### Permanent Media Redirects

Three endpoints serve **stable, shareable URLs** that 302-redirect to a short-lived presigned R2 URL. These take a public session ID (UUID) in the path rather than the secret token — safe to embed in `<img>`, `<video>`, or external services.

```
GET /api/media/:sessionId/thumbnail.jpg   →  302 to presigned JPEG URL (1h)
GET /api/media/:sessionId/video.mp4       →  302 to presigned MP4 URL (1h)
GET /api/media/:sessionId/video.webm      →  302 to the static "please update" video
```

- `Cache-Control: public, max-age=1800` on `thumbnail.jpg` and `video.mp4` (the *redirect itself* is cacheable for 30 min — the presigned URL it points at lives 1 hour).
- `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400` on `video.webm` — pre-0.2.0 binaries hit this; we tell them to update. WebM encoding was dropped in 0.2.0.
- `video.mp4` returns 404 unless the session is `complete` with a stored video.
- `thumbnail.jpg` returns 404 if no thumbnail has been compiled yet.
- These are the URLs surfaced in `videoUrl` / `thumbnailUrl` / `videoWebmUrl` response fields elsewhere — never link to the presigned R2 URLs directly because they expire.

---

### Batch Get Sessions

```
POST /api/sessions/batch
```

Fetch multiple sessions at once (for gallery views). Results sorted by creation date (newest first).

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "tokens": ["token1", "token2", "..."]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Validation |
|-------|------|----------|------------|
| `tokens` | string[] | yes | Max 100 tokens, each must be 64-char hex |

**Response `200 OK`:**
```json
{
  "sessions": [
    {
      "token": "...",
      "status": "complete",
      "trackedSeconds": 123,
      "screenshotCount": 45,
      "startedAt": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-01T11:50:00.000Z",
      "totalActiveSeconds": 300,
      "thumbnailUrl": "https://...",
      "videoUrl": "https://...",
      "metadata": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

**Errors:**
- `400` — Missing or invalid tokens array, or more than 100 tokens
- `429` — Rate limit exceeded

---

## Client Upload Flow

1. **Create session** — `POST /api/internal/sessions` (server-side)
2. **Get upload URL** — `GET /api/sessions/:token/upload-url`
3. **Upload JPEG** — `PUT <uploadUrl>` with `Content-Type: image/jpeg` (direct to R2)
4. **Confirm upload** — `POST /api/sessions/:token/screenshots`
5. Repeat steps 2-4 every 60 seconds
